Some experiment with README
# H1
## Some h2
##### it h5
## H2
### H3
#### H4
In my opinion use some *asterisks* or _underscores_, italic lines is good start for attract attention and storg **asterisks** or __underscores__ is more, we could use combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_** and Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

List style 
1. First item
2. Another 
..* With Unordered sub-list
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

Links
