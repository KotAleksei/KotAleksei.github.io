In my opinion use some *asterisks* or _underscores_, italic lines is good start for attract attention and storg **asterisks** or __underscores__ is more, we could use combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_** and Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

List style 
1. First item
2. Another 
..* With Unordered sub-list
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

Links 

[Some experiment with link](https://www.google.com)

We should add +1 Enter always 

[And link with title](https://www.google.com "Argument")

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. 
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes 
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks , or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks -- they're easier and only they support syntax highlighting.

```C++
int a = 12;
```



```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```HTML
<div class="some_block">
<a href="#">Some link here</a>
</div>
<p>Text here</p>
```

```CSS 
p {
	color: yellow;
	background-color: green;
}
```
